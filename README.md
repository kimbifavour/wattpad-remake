# Wattpad Landing Page Remake

This Repository is a recreation of an already made webpage - wattpad.com

## Why you might ask? 🤷🏻‍♀️

Well, I'm in the process of learning UI/UX and the recurring, most important tip every learning resource talks about is "copy-work" 😂 (No, seriously)
If I'm going to improve design skills, I need to recreate as many design as possible, whilst also coming up with my own 'original concepts'. 
So there you have it.

## Process

As always, I redesigned the page using figma first (this makes it easier to code... I think)
Then using my trustee Visual studio and what little knowledge I have on web programming, I've scraped together a somewhat viewable version 
of the main website 😅

## Link to Design (Expectation)
Here's a link to the figma re-design
